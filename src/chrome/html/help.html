		The Epicmafia Enhancement Suite has many useful features that may just make your time on Epicmafia more enjoyable. When you click on the extension icon, you will be greeted with a toggleable list of the major scripts included in EES:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>ActionSearch</b> - Allows for quickly searching the <a href="https://epicmafia.com/moderator">moderator actions</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>AutoRefresh</b> - Refreshes the game list regularly while you're in the lobby
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>CompMatch</b> - See percentages of which players have played together in a <a href="https://epicmafia.com/round">competition round</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Don't Autoplay Videos</b> - Prevents profile videos from autoplaying
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>emConsole</b> - Allows you to perform many common EM actions from a text console for maximum efficiency. Press <i>Ctrl + ~</i> to show the console and type <i>help</i> to see a list of commands. Press <i>~</i> while the console is open to refocus your cursor on the console after clicking away.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>emjack</b> - A <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/4503-emjack/">script</a> made by <a href="https://epicmafia.com/u/cub#/">Foxie</a> that adds many useful features, commands, and shortcuts to games of mafia. EES functions similarly to Tampermonkey in that it regularly grabs the latest version of Foxie's emjack from <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/4503-emjack/">greasyfork</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>emNote</b> - Adds a tab to the top left of your screen that allows you to write and autosave notes
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>ForumTracker</b> - Gives the option to track forum topics and receive desktop notifications when there are new posts. Click the <i>Track</i> at the top of a topic you want to track.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		EES also includes CustEM, a script by <a href="https://epicmafia.com/user/238019#/">Floor</a> that gives more display options to lobbies, and an additional script that prevents setup creation from breaking.
